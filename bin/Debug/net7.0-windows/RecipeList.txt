Ingredients

2  large marshmallows
4  waffle cones
3  roll robbery
1  tube hard topping milk chocolate or licorice
sprinkles
13  pack ice cream (500 ml each)
1/2  sandwich split in half
1  tube caramel sauce
125 g fresh raspberries
2 dl Whipped Cream
about 15  fresh cherries

The recipe is for 10-15 servings.

Place a large tray in the freezer at least 30 minutes before you start.

Press the marshmallows onto two straws. Dip the marshmallows, the bottom of the cones and the top of two of the rolls in the Hard Topping and then in the sprinkles.

Punch out three rounds from four of the ice cream packets, about 4–5 cm in diameter, with a glass or a round cake tin. Place three rounds on top of each other until you have four towers. Place in the freezer. Split the sandwich along the ice cream and place in the freezer.

Take the tray out of the freezer. Sprinkle sprinkles on six of the ice cream packages. Place two packets on the tray as front and back and one packet on each short side so that they form a rectangle. Press the sandwich halves together like a gate on the front. Place the two sprinkled roll strips along either side and press the third over the gate.

Place the towers in the corners of the castle. Drizzle over the Hard Topping and stick the cones upside down on top. Place the last three ice cream packages on top of each other and place in the center of the castle. Drizzle over caramel sauce and push down the marshmallow sticks.

Place raspberries along the walls around the castle. Sprinkle cream on top and press in cherries. Decorate with mini rings.
